# Abstract

The purpose of this project is to build a website for the Fiveum project, an alternative to Slack
that focuses on the needs of knowledge workers, namely, avoiding interruptions and keeping track of
multiple tasks.

The project is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/), a static website
building tool whose input is a Markdown-like syntax. The hosting is done on [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
